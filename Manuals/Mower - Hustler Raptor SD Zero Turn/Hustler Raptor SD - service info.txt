Aren't those electronic ignitions? If so plugs may never need changing, the mower will wear out first. The fuel filter shouldn't need to be changed often either.

These Kawasaki models say not to screw the dipstick down when checking the fluid level.  Also don't buy the tune up kits, they are overpriced

So many people fall for these kits. They are over priced and unknowing suckers fall for their propaganda.
All these major manufactures hope to make money off of inexperienced customers who know nothing
about maintenance of a mower engine.
