http://www.fixya.com/support/t418696-e20_error_when_starting_tumble_dry_cycle

E20 on your machine means some sort of Drain problem. If it actually goes through the Spin cycle o.k. then there is most likely some water still not drained out at the time of the tumble dry. Check the drain to make sure it isn't clogged. also the drain hose.




http://www.fixya.com/support/t1584398-error_message_washing_machine_e20

E20 is "A problem with water draining"
Solutions:
The drain hose may be squashed or kinked
the drain pump may be blocked
or possible your filter is totally blocked. Clean out the filter everything will work again. Put a large bowl under the filter as you unscrew it; a fair amount of water could be there.
Good luck.Please rate the solution if accepted, also do post comments in case of any doubts.

Hi

Error code e20 means a clogged drain pump. This might have happened due to small clips, pins, coins, etc being stuck in the pump. Please note that error e20 can also occur when the drain pump is not pumping fast enough or when the pump fails. To fix the issue you'll need to check the drain pump. Tilt the machine on its side and remove the 3 screws and 2 wires that hold the pump in place. Hope this helps... Please post back for any further assistance.

Machine Fixed With Excellent Service

5 out of 5, reviewed on Oct 07, 2016
Works perfectly...The serviceman they sent out the last two times is a top quality trades person...Would recommend him to anyone who wants good quality work.

Service dept is friendly and prompt...Thank you ....Extended warranty was a blessing and inexpensive....Worth every dollar...Machine is now excellent...Washes fast...No rock and roll...Spin dries everything and clothes come out clean...Note even if the waste hose breaks ...Its covered by warranty.

Not happy!

This machine is not even a year old, it's constantly coming up with errors! I am tired of rebalancing this silly machine. You hear the drum bash around like a tin can. I've tried washing 4x and just keeps saying this silly error code. I am so angry I wasted my money on this piece of junk!

Worse machine I ever owned! Never buy another! Just gave to neighbours they will probably never speak to me again E17 EFO, you want an error message here it is Simpson. 9.5 kg stainless steel drum meant to make washing easier, hardest machine ever to own and the first constant beeping, it is mental material!

This machine can only handle a full 9.5kg load, anything less and it dances around the laundry until it shuts off. I am constantly moving items around to regain balance, I have to nanny this machine day in and day out over and over again. Disappointing and frustrating to say the least.

Waste of money. Constant beeping drives you insane!

1 out of 5, reviewed on Jul 31, 2016
This machine is a waste of time and money. I bought it solely because I loved my old washing machine (also a top loader Simpson). Boy am I disappointed in this one! I bought it it 2012 from Harvey Norman and almost instantly the constant beeping drove me nuts. No longer could I put on a load of washing as I went to bed and hang it out in the morning as it beeps and beeps and just doesn't stop! The constant resetting of wash preferences is a ridiculous concept, and only 4 years later I am ready to toss it on the council pick up. Often there are white marks left on clothes regardless of the amount or type of detergent used, and almost every load becomes unbalanced with error code e17 showing on the display regardless of the load size. EFO code also displays regularly. When it finally spins it sounds like an aircraft taking off. Noisy, unreliable, and ultimately a waste of time, effort and money. Simpson has lost me as a repeat customer.

Totally Dud EziSet Series

1 out of 5, reviewed on Jul 20, 2016
Had it since 2011 with extended warranty, that ran out 2 months ago.
All up 10 repair jobs of different kinds, most of them more than once.
The incessant beeping when it behaves and completes wash is stupid. We don't need reminding.
It and the lesser kg EziSet models are duds. Never again for Simpson/Electrolux.
Note throughout this the constant answer is to e-mail them and not give the answer?

Hi Leslie, with me getting it fixed would require the third switch replacement. Not a lot of money for $60 switch, but given switch hasn't been re-engineered and labour, seems not worth it.

I cannot recommend this machine, it drives me crazy with error codes!

2 out of 5, reviewed on Jun 19, 2016
This machine does my head in! We got it as we thought the it was a great brand and huge capacity, however, we constantly get the E17 message and have to rearrange the wet washing inside to re-balance even when there is not much in the machine, it is ridiculous how many times that happens. Now, the hinge on the lid has broken and we are getting the E20 message, have checked the hoses, has not fixed problem so I am wondering if it has something to do with the lid not being able to lock??. Our previous machine lasted over 12 years (different brand - should have bought that brand again!), this thing is only 4 years old and we will need to pay for repairs, not at all happy with it.

Worst washing machine I have ever owned.

1 out of 5, reviewed on Jun 04, 2016
Same problems as everyone else, constantly unbalanced and E17 code flashing. Obviously a design fault. Product should have been recalled. I also always use front loader powder in correct amounts but have never been able to do a warm wash as it will then flash the code for to many suds. Will never buy Simpson again.

The machine was purchased approx 12 months ago. It broke down in Aug last year and parts had to be replaced, problem with the suspension. It has now broken down again with the same problem. Reported fault on wed to simpson, repair was cancelled for some reason and now be looked at till mon. What a joke! You only have to read how many negative reviews simpson washing machines have on this page to see that I got a lemon.

This would be the worst piece of overpriced junk

1 out of 5, reviewed on Jun 01, 2016
Can't believe the e17 issues I have continuously re levelled the machine with no luck. I would never touch another Simpson product again!! Stay away and don't make the same mistakes I have. It's only 4 years old and tKes us 4 hours to wash clothes in which you need to sit next to it lifting the lid continuously.

Same issue not impressed with this machine

1 out of 5, reviewed on May 26, 2016
Well I have the same problem as all the other 15 pages of complaints here and even after replacing the 4 suspension rods because the plastic housing breaks I still have issues not to mention the broken plastics hinges that are part of the lid. How many complaints does it take Simpson. Don't ask me to contact you Simpson unless your fixing it for free.

I'm glad it's not just me!!

1 out of 5, reviewed on May 18, 2016
i bought this machine thinking it would save me time, but the hours spent resetting, rebalancing & trying to keep a lid on my frustration have meant that I've wasted time, and wasted money. After having a technician out twice to try & fix the infamous e17 & efo signals & a broken lid lock ie it wouldn't unlock!! I'm done with it.
I wouldnt give it away, in fact couldn't give it away as it now ceases to spin at all due to the unbalanced whatever it is inside...I'm going to try a different brand I think

This machine is so annoying, may send it back

3 out of 5, reviewed on May 17, 2016
I've had the machine less than a week. So far washing ok, no problems there. The BIG issue is the ridiculous controls. You need to turn the machine to OFF after every load....and it then completely resets all your preferred wash options. So I have to set water level, rinse type and water temp EVERY SINGLE TIME. And, I'll just add the electronic buttons are very unresponsive so it is actually really annoying and time consuming - you need to push the buttons several times to change the preferences.
My old machine was a Simpson and I am very dis appointed in this one. THEY OBVIOUSLY NEVER TESTED THIS MACHINE WITH ANYONE WHO ACTUALLY WASHES REGULALRLY ....or these little things would have been picked up immediately.
Basically it washes fine, but honestly if you wash regularly it will drive you bonkers.

Unbalanced: Get Maintenance callouts until it is resolved

3 out of 5, reviewed on Apr 24, 2016
I put up with the unbalance problem for a very long time and went to this page for information. On review of the advice I called for a maintenance visit. They replaced all the stabilizers as a couple were broken. the next time I used the machine it went out of balance. I decided to pursue the issue and called for another maintenance visit before I ran out of warranty. The repairer replaced the computer chip and I have not had a problem since.

Overpriced piece of Junk

1 out of 5, reviewed on Mar 11, 2016
Had the SWT954 for 3.5 years and used it no more than 5 times a week. Last 6 months the infamous E17 'unbalance' messages appeared more frequently.
Rang Electrolux, usual story "out of Warranty" "$150 to send techi out to look at the machine".
We paid $700 for the machine and our previous Simpson lasted 15 years without a problem. What a Rip off!
I pulled the machine apart and found 2 of the 4 suspension rods broken. Replaced these myself for $77 plus 1 hour of my time.
Obviously a poorly designed machine with substandard parts. The re tail store where I purchased the replacement rods said "this is the most common part we sell"!
Electrolux are double gouging by relying on expensive servicing costs of a poorly built machine.
What do Electrolux charge for this part and labour. $300 to $400?
Be warned everyone. Not good enough Electrolux. I want my $77 back.
