Does the trick
Started a ve 6L with no problems, the unit still had pretty much full power left. Just remember to charge it overnight before first use. Would be good if it came with a car charger to connect to cig lighter socket for travelling. Work light and usb socket are nice features. Would recommend buying.

Game changer!
Needed something that would assist starting my early model 70 hp tractor whose battery was on its last leg. Had enough power to help crank it over. Was happy with it's performance and being on sale was able to purchase for a good price. Ken

Stopped working 1 month out of warranty
The charger will not fully charge the jumper kit and it discharges unless it is plugged in all the time on charge. It's not very good.
