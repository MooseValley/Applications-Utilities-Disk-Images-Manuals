Reference Number: 70022100
Put me on hold while he reviewed prior notes.  OK.

New EFTPOS machine - Ingenico.
Pre-Auth - already enabled
We need:
* Pre-Auth - enable Cancellation

Josh it has been approved and just needs to be turned on for our terminal.
Josh will chase up the team while I stay on hold.  OK.

This is my 4th phone call.

This was supposed to be set-up for us 7+ days ago.

Pre-Auth Cancellation not available.

I need to

Full Refund - I need to call Fiserv
How do I get a receipt ?
How do I had the customer a receipt when they demand one ?

	5847	15-Oct-2021	@ 13:47  $200 - now cancelled
	1010  22-Oct-2021	@ 15:21  $200 - now cancelled
	7847  16-Oct-2021	@ 17:34  $200 - now cancelled
	1010  17-Oct-2021	@ 12:04	$200 - now cancelled

EFI Team


I need to complete FIRST.

If I do a Pre-Auth for $10.00.
And then do a COMPLETION for $1 - Me (the motel) gets $1 and the customer gets $9.00.
CONFIRMED.
This is sort of OK, but the receipt does says COMPLETE $1.00.  It does NOT say REFUND $9.00.
If we give the customer this receipt they will argue.

Alternative option:
* Complete for Full amount and then REFUND for full amount.

We might as well charge them the full amount and then REFUND them.
Josh agreed.

Pre-Auth Cancellation
* Essential to our business
* Can we get a terminal that supports it ?  What terminal choices do we have ?
* Josh said: No, we don't provide functionality for Pre-Auth Cancellations.
* Our old terminal had Pre-Auth Cancellation (was replaced by new terminal about 2 weeks ago)
* This new terminal is supposed to have everything the old terminal had .. it doesn't have Pre-Auth Cancellation !!
* Josh will check with his EFI team again (me on hold again).


He is going to request his Terminal Team to see if there are any options for Pre-Auth Cancellation - another terminal, upgrades, etc.

* Our old terminal had Pre-Auth Cancellation (was replaced by new terminal about 2 weeks ago)
* This new terminal is supposed to have everything the old terminal had .. it doesn't have Pre-Auth Cancellation !!
The new terminal never had Pre-Auth Cancellation
You should never have
* She said: You must COMPLETE for the FULL amount.
* I said I have just done a Pre-Auth on my credit card for $10.00, with Josh on the line, and then did a COMPLETION for $0.01, and then a Batch Settlement which showed the $0.01 - so the motel got the $0.01 - which is correct.  Presumably the $9.99 is on it's way back to my credit card ...  Can she check / comfirm on her end.
* She didn't know you coud do this.  She thought you had to COMPLETE for the FULL amount.
* She will check with her technical people and phone me back.

Pre-Auth Cancellation might be an option down the road, but now now.
She said must COMPLETE the pre-Auth in full, and then do a separate redund of any amount I want to refund.
I said might as well charge full and refund $200
If we don't do anything to a Pre-Auth what happens ?  It is automatically refunded to the client but can take them up to 30 days for issuing bank to process this.

The big
I have just cancelled all 4 outstanding Pre-Auth's with Josh.

	5847	15-Oct-2021	@ 13:47  $200 - now cancelled
	1010  22-Oct-2021	@ 15:21  $200 - now cancelled
	7847  16-Oct-2021	@ 17:34  $200 - now cancelled
	1010  17-Oct-2021	@ 12:04	$200 - now cancelled

Only person who can see the cancelled Pre-Auth is the issuing bank.
It usually takes them 1-2 days for them to process the cancellation.

I said that we have cancelled pre-auths in the past and it has taken the issuing bank 7-10 days or more to release the payment back to the client.
