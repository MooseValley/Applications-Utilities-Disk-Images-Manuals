Need to speak to Merchant Services ... not EFTPOS Terminal Support
1 -> 4


Pre-Auth - already enabled
We need:
* Pre-Auth - enable Completion / Cancellation

This is my 3rd phone call.



Melody
* She can see that my "Pre-Auth - enable Completion / Cancellation" request is in their system, she will check on what is going on.
* She reckons that "Pre-Auth Completion" is already done and should be on my terminal now.
* She will re-raise my "Pre-Auth Cancellation" request - as a follow up request - and TAG it as urgent.

Reference Number: 70022100

I said "Pre-Auth Completion" is NOT available on my machine.
I can see the option in the User manual, but it is not showing on my terminal.
Do I need to do a reset or something ?

She could not answer ...

She will transfer me to Technical Support to check out Pre-Auth Completion

Dan
* terrible phone line, breaking up badly.
* Claims it will be 1-2 business days more before these options are enabled on my terminal.
* said they will call me when it is done.
* I need to refresh my terminal - she sais press Function 102 - does NOT make sense.
1 = Transaction, 0 = not available,
asked her to speak slowly and clearly and still could not get what she was saying.
Fucking hopeless.

After I got off the phone from here I looked in the manual,
saw the "FUNC" key ... ahh, I see now - why didn't she say press the FUNC key ?????

FUNC 102

The Pre-Auth Completion option is NOW there (but on a different menu to the manual)

I cannot do a Completion for 0
it will not let me proceed.

CANCEL is definitely required.

EOF.
