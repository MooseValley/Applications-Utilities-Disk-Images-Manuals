Description

Roland’s KF-7 Digital Intelligent Piano gives you the best of both worlds: the fine realistic touch and authentic sound of an acoustic grand piano, and a host of advanced but easy-to-use playing features and functions – like the amazing DigiScore™ score display – that are only available in a Roland digital piano. And it’s housed in a compact and stylish new design that perfectly suits the modern home. Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, the KF-7 delivers powerful musical expression and endless piano-playing fun.

Equipped with powerful features including DigiScore with Touch the Notes, Music Assistant, Wonderland and so on
Latest stereo-sampled Roland piano sounds, and variety of instrument tones and 128-voice polyphony
Responsive 88-note Progressive Hammer-Action Keyboard and half-pedal recognition feature for expressive piano performance 3 pedal jacks (Damper / Sostenuto / Soft) for perfect piano performance, can be assigned for many unique features such as “Replay.” Powerful onboard speakers. Compact, stylish and attractive chocolate brown body. Incredibly rich, natural piano sound

The KF-7 incorporates the very latest of Roland’s piano stereo sampling and sound source technology. So it sounds just like a full concert acoustic grand, delivering the same natural, dynamic richness, down to the most delicate nuance. In addition, the KF-7 lets you customize its piano sounds to suit your taste: you can even simulate the way the tone and colour of the sound change on a grand piano depending on the position of its lid. And the KF-7’s four powerful built-in speakers add vibrancy and expansive depth to your music. Plus, a powerful new sound source provides 128-voice polyphony, so you don’t need to worry about note cutoffs when playing. It’s perfect for making music at home-or on stage.

Authentic acoustic piano keyboard touch

On an acoustic grand piano, the greater the difference in keyboard touch when playing pianissimo and fortissimo, the greater the richness of expression possible. The KF-7’s keyboard faithfully simulates this touch difference. It’s Roland’s unique Progressive Hammer Action Keyboard,
with a dynamic hammer touch variation. It gives a lighter touch in the upper range, a heavier touch in the lower range, a lighter resistance when
playing soft pianissimo passages and a stronger resistance on fortissimo passages. Its true piano feel and playing performance will deliver each delicate nuance of your fingers, with the same expressiveness as an acoustic grand.

Responsive pedal feature for more piano expression

The KF-7 can respond to half-damper or half-soft pedal playing, for even more authentic, rich piano expression. To create the most realistic piano experience possible for players of any level, the KF-7 comes with three pedal connection ports (Damper/Sostenuto/Soft) to attach up to three pedals* (optional) for a more expressive performance.

*The KF-7 comes with one DP-8 pedal as an accessory-so you can enjoy the half-pedaling feature the moment you bring it home.

Stylish, modern design

The KF-7 is a statement in style. With its contemporary design and compact body, it’s a welcome addition to any modern interior. You’ll love its subdued chocolate brown colour and attractive acrylic music stand…and the fact that it’s so easily portable.

DigiScore: your window to new musical possibilities

Roland’s unique DigiScore brings new possibilities and enjoyment to playing and practicing the piano. You can access almost all major functions-like Touch the Notes-effortlessly, with a few touches of a finger to the centralized touchscreen panel and six surrounding control buttons.

The remarkable “Score Display”

Push the “Score Display” button, and the music score is displayed right on Roland’s amazing DigiScore. You can display the score notations for all the preset songs, for songs you record yourself, or for SMF data. Even better, you can enlarge the score display, show the staff along with
the note name, finger number, chord name, or lyrics, or display the right-hand part or left-hand part only. You can even store a score image on a floppy disk as a bitmap file and print it out using your PC. Learning and composing have never been simpler or more fun!”Touch the Notes” and helpful “Replay” pedal

Touch any note head on the DigiScore screen, and the note is played automatically. Drag your fingertip over a phrase or series of notes to highlight them, and the sequence is played back immediately. Or, display the score along with a picture of the keyboard, so that when you touch any note, both the note and the corresponding key are indicated. You can check the notes both visually and aurally. What could be easier?

And more, you can assign the soft pedal to function as the “Replay” pedal. Press the pedal during playback to stop the music. Release the pedal, and playback resumes from the start of that measure, so you can try that phrase again. It’s just one more way the DigiScore makes practicing and playing the piano more fun than ever.

Ideal accompaniment with “Music Assistant”

The KF-7 comes with an advanced automatic accompaniment function. You just play simple chords with your left hand, and the accompaniment automatically follows your lead on the melody, in your choice of several music genres. Your performance becomes much more exciting and entertaining. The “Music Assistant” is a uniquely intuitive help function for backup accompaniment. Simply select a keyword that resembles the song title you want to play, and the intelligent auto-setup help function chooses an auto-accompaniment style that suits that song perfectly. The KF-7 has more than 130 Music Assistant pre-settings-each with 4 different variations-for professional backup accompaniment. You can change the
accompaniment to different musical styles such as Latin or jazz, and add fancy introductions and endings for an exciting and rousing performance.

Wide selection of preset songs

The KF-7 comes with over 170 built-in preset songs. Select the song you’d like by genre, or insert a floppy disk of SMF data for even more choices. The scores for all songs appear right on the screen. So you can play along with the presets, record and play back your performance, and much more!

“Select Various Tones” for an exciting performance

The KF-7 puts over 600 instrument sound at your fingertips, grouped into easily-selectable categories: piano, organ, violin, guitar, saxophone, drums, and others. The expressive “Tone EX” tones deliver tonal various when you hit the keys at different strengths. “Pedal EX” tones change the sound and expression when you press down the pedal. There is also Layer function to layer two tones on top of each other, and Split mode to select a different tone for each hand.

“Song Stylist:” time for some fun!

With just a few button touches, you can instantly rearrange any preset song with chord data into a different style. So you can play a jazz song as rock, or pop song as classical. Use the “Music Style” button on the panel for even more possibilities.

Your own band: “Session Partner”

Play with your very own backing band. Select up to five virtual band members, and set their playing patterns and styles. You can specify the chord progression, and add automatic harmony. Your own original backing band will be right behind you.

Karaoke and Vocal Effects

Connect a microphone to built-in jack for karaoke singing. Lyrics appear on the screen. You can also add vocal effects like Harmonist to your singing, Voice Transformer to alter your voice, Echo, and many others.

“Wonderland”

The KF-7 contains Roland’s “edu-tainment” feature called “Wonderland,” designed specifically for children. With animated onscreen graphics, and variety of instrument sounds, children can enjoy six exciting musical and note-guessing games to help them develop their ear for music and their sense of rhythm.
